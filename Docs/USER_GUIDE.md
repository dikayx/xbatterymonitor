# XBM User Guide

XBM is a simple and convenient Windows companion app designed to notify users when their gamepad battery is running low. This guide will walk you through the app’s features and settings to help you get started.

## Main Features

-   Low Battery Notifications: XBM alerts you when your gamepad’s battery level falls below a specified threshold.

-   Customizable Battery Threshold: Set the battery level at which you wish to receive notifications.

-   Sleep Threshold and Notification Intervals: Adjust the app’s behavior to minimize unnecessary alerts.

-   Autostart: Optionally, configure the app to start automatically with Windows.

## Settings Overview

1. **Autostart Settings**

    - Autostart with Windows: Check this box to have XBM launch automatically when your computer starts.

2. **Connection Status**

    - Battery Percentage: Displays the current battery level of the connected gamepad (if available).

    - Controller Status: Indicates whether a gamepad is connected or disconnected.

3. **Battery Settings**

    - Selected Battery Threshold: Use the slider to set the battery level (in percentage) at which the app will notify you. For example, if you set it to 20%, you will receive notifications when your gamepad battery falls below this level.

4. **Notification Settings**

    - Sleep Threshold (minutes): Specify the duration for which notifications are paused after the first alert. For example, setting this to 1 minute ensures you won’t be notified repeatedly within this time frame.

    - Notification Interval (minutes): Set the frequency of notifications. For instance, if set to 5 minutes, the app will remind you about the low battery every 5 minutes.

## How to Use XBM

1. **Install and Launch:**

    - Follow the [installation instructions](INSTALLATION.md) to set up XBM on your Windows PC. Once installed, the app will run in the background.

2. **Connect Your Gamepad:**

    - Ensure your gamepad is connected to your PC. The app will display the connection status and battery percentage once a supported controller is detected.

3. **Adjust Settings:**

    - Use the sliders and input boxes to configure your preferred settings. Don’t forget to click the Save button to apply any changes.

4. **Receive Notifications:**

    - XBM will monitor your gamepad’s battery level and notify you when it falls below the set threshold.

5. **Autostart (Optional):**

    - Enable the "Autostart with Windows" option if you want the app to run automatically on startup.

## Tips and Recommendations

-   **Default Threshold**: A 20% battery threshold is a good starting point, ensuring you have enough time to recharge or replace your batteries before they run out.

-   **Save your resources**: Adjust the sleep threshold and notification interval to avoid frequent alerts and conserve system resources.

-   **Keep the App Updated**: Check the [releases page](https://github.com/dikayx/xbatterymonitor/releases) for the latest version of XBM.

## Troubleshooting

-   **Gamepad Not Detected:**

    -   Ensure your gamepad is properly connected to your PC.

    -   Verify that your gamepad drivers are installed and up-to-date.

-   **Battery Percentage Not Available:**

    -   Some gamepads may not support battery level reporting. XBM will still notify you based on connection status in such cases.

-   **Notifications Not Working:**

    -   Make sure XBM is running in the background.

    -   Check your Windows notification settings to ensure XBM is allowed to send alerts.

With XBM, you can enjoy uninterrupted gaming sessions without worrying about sudden battery depletion. Configure your settings, and let XBM handle the rest!
